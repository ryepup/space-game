This is a playground for me to try different tech.

Basic approach: tons of javascript speaking JSON to a server.  Server only speaks JSON, and HTML pages are few. (screw links)


* UI
** tabs
*** Dashboard
**** cargo
**** money over time
*** Systems
**** travel to other systems
***** travel time
**** for nearby systems
***** news
***** markets
***** travel time
*** Planets (n)
**** buy/sell cargo
**** news
*** Ships (n)
**** buy/sell ships
**** buy/sell equipment for a ship
** status bar on bottom
*** money
*** time (turn #)
*** current location
* Backend
** players specify orders, then get resolved
*** option to allow game to continue without all orders?
*** orders may take more than one turn
* design choices
** long-lived browser window
** server speaks mostly JSON
** playable by a bot
** slow evolution of game and world
* tech to try out
** JQuery
** canvas
** Hunchentoot
** Elephant
** adw-charting
** vecto
** dynamic animated gifs
** cl-unification
* work log
** DONE setup github account, initial readme, got local setup ready to start lisping
