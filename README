This is a playground for me to try different tech.

Basic approach: tons of javascript speaking JSON to a server.  Server only speaks JSON, and HTML pages are few. (screw links)


* UI
** tabs
*** Dashboard
**** cargo
**** money over time
*** Systems
**** travel to other systems
***** travel time
**** for nearby systems
***** news
***** markets
***** travel time
*** Planets (n)
**** buy/sell cargo
**** news
*** Ships (n)
**** buy/sell ships
**** buy/sell equipment for a ship
** status bar on bottom
*** money
*** time (turn #)
*** current location
* Backend
** players specify orders, then get resolved
*** option to allow game to continue without all orders?
*** orders may take more than one turn
* design choices
** planet economies/markets
Each planet produces and consumes goods at a certain rate, and has a supply.

Each turn affects the supplies at each planet.

market price is determined by 3 variables:
 * consumption rate
 * production rate
 * supply

First, we calculate the usage rate as production - consumption
From there, we have two formulas:
 * if the usage is 0, price = 10 * (production / supply)
 * else price = 10 * (usage / supply)
This is probably still flawed.

| consumption | production | supply | should be     | rate |
|           5 |          5 |     10 | around zero   |      |
|          10 |          5 |   1000 | negative      |      |
|          10 |          5 |     10 | high          |      |
|           5 |         10 |     10 | positive      |      |
|           5 |         10 |   1000 | very negative |      |

Every turn there is a random chance of the rates changing, 
too keep a dynamic environment.

** long-lived browser window
** server speaks mostly JSON
** playable by a bot
** slow evolution of game and world
* tech to try out
** JQuery
** canvas
** Hunchentoot
** Elephant
** adw-charting
** vecto
** dynamic animated gifs
** cl-unification
* work log
** plan out how the economies should work, get some basic trading functions done.
